        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Mansaf is a traditional Jordanian dish that consist of a combination of lamb meat, aromatic yellow rice, and a rich, jameed yogurt. <br>
           Originally it is a food very specific to the bedouins of Jordan, but it became very popular in the entire levant and Arab world and is commonly served

        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Get the ingredients ready:</strong> 
              <ul>
                <li>If you're using jameed, break it into pieces and soak them in water for a few hours.</li>
                <li>Wash the lamb thoroughly, then rinse the rice 2–3 times and let it soak in water.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          
            <li>
                <strong>Heat the oil:</strong> Add some olive oil to a pressure cooker and heat it over high heat.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Toast the spices:</strong> Once the oil is hot, turn the heat down to medium. Toss in the peppercorns, cinnamon sticks, cardamom pods, cloves and bay leaves, and cook them for 2–3 minutes, stirring occasionally.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Brown the lamb:</strong> When the spices become fragrant, add the lamb pieces. Cook and stir them occasionally until they brown and change color.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Add water:</strong> Pour enough water to cover the lamb and bring it to a boil.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Skim the foam:</strong> Skim off any foam that rises to the surface.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Pressure cook the lamb:</strong> Close the pressure cooker, lower the heat, and let it cook for at least an hour. I like to leave it for 1.5 hours to make sure the lamb is super tender.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Release the steam:</strong> Once the lamb is done, release the steam from the pressure cooker and take the lid off.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Prepare the yogurt sauce:</strong> In a bowl, mix the jameed or plain yogurt with some hot lamb broth until smooth. Make sure the sauce stays hot.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Turn up the heat:</strong> Increase the heat under the lamb back to high.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Add the yogurt sauce:</strong> Slowly pour the yogurt sauce into the broth, a little at a time, stirring constantly. Let the broth come back to a boil between each addition.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Fry the garlic:</strong> Chop the garlic and fry it in a bit of olive oil until golden brown, then add it to the mansaf sauce.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Season the sauce:</strong> Stir in some salt, then taste and adjust as needed.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Cook the rice:</strong> Drain the soaked rice.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Fry the rice:</strong> In a medium pot, heat some olive oil. Add the rice and fry it for 2–3 minutes, stirring now and then.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Cook the rice:</strong> Add hot water (about 2 cups of water for every cup of rice), bring it to a boil, then lower the heat to a simmer.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Season the rice:</strong> Add salt, black pepper, and 1–2 teaspoons of turmeric. Stir it all together, cover the pot, and let it cook for about 20 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Prepare the garnish:</strong> While the rice is cooking, fry the nuts until golden, chop the parsley, and set them aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Check the rice:</strong> After about 15–20 minutes, check if the water has evaporated. If it has, turn off the heat.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Assemble the mansaf:</strong> Tear the flatbread into pieces and spread it over a large serving plate.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Soak the bread:</strong> Ladle some of the mansaf sauce over the bread, making sure it’s well-soaked.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Layer it all:</strong> Spread the rice over the soaked bread, then place the lamb on top. Sprinkle the fried nuts and chopped parsley around the lamb for garnish.</li>
        </ol>
